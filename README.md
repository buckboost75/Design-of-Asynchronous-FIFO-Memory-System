# Design-of-Asynchronous-FIFO-Memory-System

◦ Developed a full FIFO system in Verilog, including the Write Control module, Read Control module, Syn
chronizer, and Dual-Ported RAM.


◦ Implemented binary to gray code conversion and 2-FF synchronizing techniques to optimize and prevent
 metastability issues in asynchronous scenarios.
